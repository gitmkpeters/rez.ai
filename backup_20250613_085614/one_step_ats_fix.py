            5. **VALUE PROPOSITION**: Clearly state how the candidate solves the employer's specific needs

            - Start with the candidate's years of experience and primary expertise area
            - Include 3-5 key skills/technologies mentioned in the job posting
            - Mention 1-2 quantified achievements that align with job requirements
